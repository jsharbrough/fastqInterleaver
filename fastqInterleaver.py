    '''Takes two paired-end fastq read files as input (preferably paired-end 
    reads) and interleaves them. Only paired reads will be retained in the 
    output fastq. The program will interleave paired forward and reverse reads 
    and write them to standard out, listing forward reads first in the output 
    file to conform with convention.To run, open a Unix environment and type the 
    following:
    
    python fastqInterleaver.py forwardReads reverseReads > out.fastq
